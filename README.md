*Note: This task should take no longer than 1-2 hours at the most.*


### Prerequisites

- Please note that this will require some basic [JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) and [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) knowledge.

- You will need to have [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org/) installed to complete this task.

## Task

1. Fork this repository (if you don't know how to do that, Google is your friend)
2. Create a *source* folder to contain your code.
3. In the *source* directory, please create an ExpressJS app that accomplishes the following:
    - Connect to the [Github API](http://developer.github.com/)
    - Find the [nodejs/node](https://github.com/nodejs/node) repository
    - Find the most recent commits (choose at least 25 or more of the commits)
    - Create a route that displays the recent commits by author.
    - If the commit hash ends in a number, color that row to light blue (#E6F1F6).
4. Commit and Push your code to your new repository
